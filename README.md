[![Ansible Galaxy](https://img.shields.io/badge/galaxy-redhatcop.jcliff-blue.svg)](https://galaxy.ansible.com/redhat-cop/jcliff)

This repository contains tooling to support utilizing [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) with the [jcliff](https://github.com/bserdar/jcliff) utility to manage [Red Hat Enterprise Application Platform (EAP)](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/application-platform) / [Wildfly](https://wildfly.org/) configuration.

## Ansible Galaxy

Content from this repository is available in [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/redhat-cop/jcliff). Installation can be facilitated by the executing the following command:

```
ansible-galaxy install redhat-cop.jcliff
```

## Installing Wildfly using Ansible

With the role install, you can directly install Widlfy using the provided playbook:

```
# cd ~/.ansible/role/...
# ansible-playbook ~/.ansible/roles/redhat-cop.jcliff/wildfly-setup.yml
```
Note that this installation is PLAIN Ansible, the role provided here is not (yet) being used. This installation also download the require artefact for setting up a Postgresql driver later on.

## Tweak your Wildfly configuration with JCliff

Once Wildfly is successfully installed and is running, you can see how to use the JCliff module, provided by this role, to fine tune the setup of your Wildfly:

```
# ansible-playbook ~/.ansible/roles/redhat-cop.jcliff/tune-wildfly-with-jcliff.yml
```

# How to work on this module

Here is a few developer tricks:
* always use -vvvv when running Ansible, use the output to use JCliff directly, validating first that the files generated by this module are correct
* use the --start-at option of Ansible Playbook command to jump directly to the module execution.
